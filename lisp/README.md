I expect LISP to take me around four hours.


It took me around two hours to finish my LISP implimentation.  Despite it being the fastest so far, it's lower than COBOL in fun languages.

check that, debugging took about an extra hour.  I thought my solution was correct, but after closer inspection realized I was wrong.
