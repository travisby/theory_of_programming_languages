Write encrypt, decrypt, and solve for each language


So, we end with saying:

    COBOL will not handle different upper/lower cases
    Scala will not handle multiple words
    (neither of which I believe were part of the requirements)
    COBOL has an issue with a key of 25 -- it acts like it's accessing adjacent memory, because its result always changes
