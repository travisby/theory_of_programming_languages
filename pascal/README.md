I've heard a few things about Pascal:
    1. Very easy to use
    2. Forces good practices

These two are conflicting in my head as I try to predict how long this will take me.

Ease of use is great when you know the language, and even if you don't.  But forcing good practices is a detrement for my "let's just get this done" mode.  

I'm estimating 5 hours of work on this.
